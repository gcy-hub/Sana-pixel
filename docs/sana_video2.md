# SANA-Video 2.0

SANA-Video 2.0 provides efficient text-to-video and text-image-to-video models
built with hybrid linear/softmax attention and Attention Residuals. This
release includes the model architecture, training and inference code, 480p
and 720p reference configs for the 5B variant, and a post-trained 5B checkpoint
for 720p, 8-second generation. The 14B config and checkpoint are not included
yet.

## Architecture

| Model | Layers | Hidden size | Linear attention | Softmax anchors | Parameters |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `SanaVideo2_5B` | 32 | 2,560 | 20 heads × 128 | 8 layers, 10 heads × 256 | 4,466,980,960 |
| `SanaVideo2_14B` | 40 | 4,096 | 32 heads × 128 | 10 layers, 16 heads × 256 | 14,246,716,224 |

Both variants use:

- 75% gated bidirectional linear-attention layers and 25% dense softmax anchor
  layers;
- SwiGLU feed-forward networks with a 4× expansion ratio;
- Wan 3D rotary position embeddings;
- shared, timestep-independent Attention Residual aggregation in blocks of
  eight layers;
- `(1, 1, 1)` latent patches; and
- the LTX 2.3 VAE contract: 128 latent channels with `(8, 32, 32)`
  temporal/spatial strides.

The released 5B checkpoint was jointly post-trained for text-to-video (T2V)
and text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation with ReFL. It contains only the
merged model `state_dict`; optimizer, scheduler, and standalone LoRA state are
not included. The checkpoint preserves the source EMA tensor values and is
cast to BF16 by the inference entry point.

The 4-step research preview is a full-model DMD EMA export initialized from
the merged ReFL step-500 model. It is T2V-only and is not a LoRA adapter. The
release artifact contains model tensors only, without optimizer or scheduler
state.

## Code layout

- Model: `diffusion/model/nets/sana_video2.py`
- Transformer blocks: `diffusion/model/nets/sana_video2_blocks.py`
- Four-step sampler: `diffusion/scheduler/fastvideo_dmd_sampler.py`
- Training: `train_video_scripts/train_video_ivjoint_chunk.py`
- Inference: `inference_video_scripts/inference_sana_video.py`
- Configs: `configs/sana_video2/`

SANA-Video 2.0 reuses the repository's existing video training and inference
entry points. No separate version-specific runner is required.

## Setup

Install the repository environment:

```bash
bash environment_setup.sh sana
conda activate sana
```

Place the Diffusers-format LTX 2.3 VAE under:

```text
output/pretrained_models/LTX-2.3-Diffusers/
```

Alternatively, update `vae.vae_pretrained` in the selected YAML. The example
configs use `data/video_toy_data`; replace `data.data_dir` with a
`SanaZipDataset`-compatible dataset for training.

## Inference

The prompt file contains one prompt per line. The released 720p model generates
193 frames at 24 FPS (about 8 seconds) in a 736×1280 bucket. It was evaluated
with classifier-free guidance 8, flow shift 12, and 50 sampling steps.

### Verified 5B 720p release example

The following sample was generated from the public checkpoint with seed 4. The
encoded result is 1280 × 736, 193 frames, 24 FPS, and 8.04 seconds long.

### Text-to-video

This is the exact command used to generate the verified example above:

```bash
bash inference_video_scripts/inference_sana_video.sh \
  --np 1 \
  --config configs/sana_video2/SanaVideo2_5B_720p.yaml \
  --model_path hf://Efficient-Large-Model/SANA-Video_2.0_5B_720p/checkpoints/SANA_Video_2.0_5B_720p.pth \
  --txt_file=asset/samples/sana_video2_5b_720p_demo.txt \
  --cfg_scale 8 \
  --flow_shift 12 \
  --step 50 \
  --fps 24 \
  --motion_score 20 \
  --seed 4 \
  --work_dir output/sana_video2_t2v_720p_demo
```

### Four-step text-to-video preview

The DMD preview uses four fixed stochastic stages, CFG 1, BF16 latent noise,
and the `sana_shift6_dpm` sigma profile. It supports a 5-second profile
(81 frames at 16 FPS) and an 8-second profile (193 frames at 24 FPS), and does
not support first-frame conditioning. The online preview defaults to the
5-second profile and RL LoRA scale 0.7. The `flow_shift` argument is retained
for CLI consistency but is not applied by this sampler. Model construction
stays at the source tower's 480 setting; `custom_height_width` controls the
actual 736×1280 latent and MP4 dimensions.

```bash
bash inference_video_scripts/inference_sana_video.sh \
  --np 1 \
  --config configs/sana_video2/SanaVideo2_5B_720p.yaml \
  --model_path hf://Efficient-Large-Model/SANA-Video_2.0_5B_720p_4step/checkpoints/SANA_Video_2.0_5B_720p_4step.pth \
  --txt_file=asset/samples/sana_video2_5b_720p_demo.txt \
  --task=t2v \
  --model.image_size=480 \
  --custom_height_width='[736,1280]' \
  --sampling_algo=fastvideo_dmd_4step \
  --generator_sigma_profile=sana_shift6_dpm \
  --cfg_scale=1.0 \
  --flow_shift=1.0 \
  --motion_score=20 \
  --negative_prompt=None \
  --num_frames=81 \
  --step=4 \
  --fps=16 \
  --seed=4 \
  --work_dir output/sana_video2_t2v_720p_4step_preview
```

The local command above runs the full checkpoint at its native RL scale 1.0.
The verified online sample below uses the same prompt, schedule, duration,
motion score, and seed, with the Space default RL LoRA scale 0.7 (1280 × 736,
81 frames, 16 FPS, 5.06 seconds). Reproduce those exact online settings with:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from gradio_client import Client

prompt = Path("asset/samples/sana_video2_5b_720p_demo.txt").read_text().strip()
video_path, seed = Client("Efficient-Large-Model/sana-video2-5b-720p-demo").predict(
    prompt=prompt,
    video_duration="5 seconds",
    rl_lora_scale=0.7,
    motion_score=20,
    seed=4,
    randomize_seed=False,
    api_name="/generate",
)
```

### Text-image-to-video

Each line in `asset/samples/sample_i2v.txt` contains a prompt and an input-image
path separated by `<image>`.

```bash
bash inference_video_scripts/inference_sana_video.sh \
  --np 1 \
  --config configs/sana_video2/SanaVideo2_5B_720p.yaml \
  --model_path hf://Efficient-Large-Model/SANA-Video_2.0_5B_720p/checkpoints/SANA_Video_2.0_5B_720p.pth \
  --txt_file=asset/samples/sample_i2v.txt \
  --task=ltx \
  --cfg_scale 8 \
  --flow_shift 12 \
  --step 50 \
  --fps 24 \
  --motion_score 20 \
  --work_dir output/sana_video2_ti2v_720p
```

Height and width must be divisible by 32, and frame counts must satisfy
`(num_frames - 1) % 8 == 0`.

## Training

The reference configs run video-only FSDP training with gradient checkpointing,
online Gemma 2 caption encoding, causal LTX 2.3 VAE encoding, and flow matching.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=29500 \
  train_video_scripts/train_video_ivjoint_chunk.py \
  --config_path configs/sana_video2/SanaVideo2_5B_480p.yaml
```

The released 720p config can also be used as the starting point for 5B
fine-tuning:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=29500 \
  train_video_scripts/train_video_ivjoint_chunk.py \
  --config_path configs/sana_video2/SanaVideo2_5B_720p.yaml
```

To resume, pass `--resume_from=<checkpoint>`. Set `model.load_from` when
initializing from a compatible model checkpoint; leave it as `null` to train
from scratch.
